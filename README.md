## Simple look

GGJ2018 theme: "Transmission".

Accomplished diversifiers: 
- ART - Stranger Things
- DESIGN - Feathered Friends
- NARRATIVE - Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story


With this thematic, my team and I, decided to work in a imaginary  airborne transmited disease  . Main character is a micro chicken suited as astronaut, who should go througth the patient's veins killing the viruses and collecting the parts of his crashed airship.

Movement in this game is mostly 2D going continously to the right, but adding the z-axis.

Elements and enemies of the environment are procedurally positioned, so the level is different each time.
